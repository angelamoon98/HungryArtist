  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>This website allows local artists to connect to local venues, primarily cafes. This spin on the idea
    of a "starving artist" is meant to empower artists to share their work. Our project seeks to correct
    issues for various artists of different backgrounds and interests. It enables artists to showcase their
    artwork at select cafes, improves venues' foot traffic, and drives increased revenue for both venue and artist.</p>

  <h2>Meet the Team</h2>

    <h3>Angela Moon</h3>
    <p>Angela is a Junior at Duke University studying Computer Science, minoring in Economics,
      and working towards a certificate in Information Science + Studies. She enjoys hiking, listening to music,
      and frequenting local cafes in her free time. Her sister is an artist
      who has found it difficult to come across avenues to show off her artwork, so Angela hopes that
      this project is a possible solution.</p>

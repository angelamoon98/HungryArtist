  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>HungryArtist is a digital platform that connects artists, venues, and art lovers by encouraging physical interaction with art forms beyond their online depictions.
    The goal of HungryArtist is to <b>create a bridge</b> between artists and venues that showcase artwork. Beyond this primary connection
    between artist and venue, HungryArtist fills a bigger void. In creating a platform for artists, venues, and the general art lovers to bond and interact,
    it promotes greater art appreciation in its full, physical form. Due to the growing prominence of information and communication
    technologies, we see a divide between digital and physical appreciation of human-created works. HungryArtist is an attempt to <b>foster a palpable connection
    and appreciation of art</b>, reversing the now immediate instinct to simply “look up” a work to appreciate it.
